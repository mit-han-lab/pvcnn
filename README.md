- [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) >= 1.3
- [numba](https://github.com/numba/numba)
- [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)

- [h5py](https://github.com/h5py/h5py)

## Data Preparation

### S3DIS

We follow the data pre-processing in [PointCNN](https://github.com/yangyanli/PointCNN).
The code for preprocessing the S3DIS dataset is located in [`data/s3dis/`](data/s3dis/prepare_data.py).
One should first download the dataset from [here](http://buildingparser.stanford.edu/dataset.html), then run 
```bash
python data/s3dis/prepare_data.py -d [path to unzipped dataset dir]
```

### ShapeNet

We follow the data pre-processing in [PointNet2](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet2). Please run the following
command to down the dataset
```bash
./data/shapenet/download.sh
```

### KITTI

For Frustum-PointNet backbone, we follow the data pre-processing in [Frustum-Pointnets](https://github.com/charlesq34/frustum-pointnets).
One should first download the ground truth labels from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_object_label_2.zip), then run
```bash
unzip data_object_label_2.zip
mv training/label_2 data/kitti/ground_truth
./data/kitti/frustum/download.sh
```

## Code

The core code to implement PVConv is [modules/pvconv.py](modules/pvconv.py). Its key idea costs only a few lines of code:

```python
    voxel_features, voxel_coords = voxelize(features, coords)
    voxel_features = voxel_layers(voxel_features)
    voxel_features = trilinear_devoxelize(voxel_features, voxel_coords, resolution)
    fused_features = voxel_features + point_layers(features)
```

## Pretrained Models

Here we provide some of the pretrained models. The accuracy might vary a little bit compared to the paper,
since we re-train some of the models for reproducibility.

### S3DIS

We compare PVCNN against the PointNet, 3D-UNet and PointCNN performance as reported in the following table.
The accuracy is tested following [PointCNN](https://github.com/yangyanli/PointCNN). The list is keeping updated.

### KITTI
We compare PVCNN (Efficient Version in the paper) against PointNets performance as reported in the following table.
The accuracy is tested on **val** set following [Frustum PointNets](https://github.com/charlesq34/frustum-pointnets) using 
modified code from [kitti-object-eval-python](https://github.com/traveller59/kitti-object-eval-python).
Since there is random sampling in Frustum Pointnets, random seed will influence the evaluation. All results provided by us
are the average of 20 measurements with different seeds, and the best one of 20 measurements is shown in the parentheses.
The list is keeping updated.

## Testing Pretrained Models

For example, to test the downloaded pretrained models on S3DIS, one can run

```
python train.py [config-file] --devices [gpu-ids] --evaluate --configs.evaluate.best_checkpoint_path [path to the model checkpoint]
```

For instance, to evaluate PVCNN on GPU 0,1 (with 4096 points on Area 5 of S3DIS), one can run

```
python train.py configs/s3dis/pvcnn/area5.py --devices 0,1 --evaluate --configs.evaluate.best_checkpoint_path s3dis.pvcnn.area5.c1.pth.tar
```

Specially, for Frustum KITTI evaluation, one can specify the number of measurements to eliminate the random seed effects,

```
python train.py configs/kitti/frustum/pvcnne.py --devices 0 --evaluate --configs.evaluate.best_checkpoint_path kitti.frustum.pvcnne.pth.tar --configs.evaluate.num_tests [#measurements]
```

## Training

We provided several examples to train PVCNN with this repo:

- To train PVCNN on S3DIS holding out Area 5, one can run
 
```
python train.py configs/s3dis/pvcnn/area5/c1.py --devices 0,1
```

In general, to train a model, one can run
 
```
python train.py [config-file] --devices [gpu-ids]
```

**NOTE**: During training, the meters will provide accuracies and IoUs.
However, these are just rough estimations.
One have to run the following command to get accurate evaluation.

To evaluate trained models, one can do inference by running:

```
python train.py [config-file] --devices [gpu-ids] --evaluate
```

## Training for Custom Dataset

To train custom dataset, you need to put point clouds data and corresponding groundtruth file under the specified folder. Their format is .npy file. The custom_dataset_loader will read files which under train and test folders as training data and testing data.

```
python custom_train.py [config-file] --devices [gpu-ids] --evaluate
```
